Hi Paul,

I am supposed to send my edits directly to prof. Lamoreaux? Would you have their e-mail address? Thank you!

		Hello Jan-Baptist,

		Thank you for volunteering to edit our Symposium Comments. I've attached Prof. Lamoreaux's piece, and we ask that you look over the comment for light edits. Feel free to suggest edits that help clarify the point or raise questions you might think it's worthwhile to address, but please refrain from heavy edits. The comment doesn't have to directly address Prof. Priest's book. As always, we ask that you frame all edits as humble recommendations and that you provide concrete examples of the edits you recommend wherever possible.

		Please send the author your edits as comments directly in the attached word doc - saved as ""Lamoreaux Credit Nation Comment_[your initials] edits_[year.month.date]. You can address any larger feedback in your email to the professor. Cc the yjlh@yale.edu account, and give the author 10 days to address your edits from the date you email them. We ask that you send your edits no later than this Friday 10/22.
		
		
		Thank you again! We are excited to have you on the team.

		Best,
		Paul
