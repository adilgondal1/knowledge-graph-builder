As you are aware, we are working with Prof. Priest to publish an issue on the Credit Nation Symposium, and we would love to include your comments.\n\nWe are not imposing a page limit, but we expect most comments to have no more than ten pages. We also recognize that not everyone will be familiar with our Bluebook citation style, and so we only ask that you use footnotes rather than in-text citations. We do prefer Chicago over any other non-Bluebook style, but given our journal's broad coverage, we're pretty familiar with it all.\n\nTo meet our publishing deadline, we ask that first drafts for all comments be sent to yjlh@yale.edu <mailto:yjlh@yale.edu>  no later than Friday, October 15th, at 11:59PM. Once we receive your comment, we will assign you an Articles Editor to work on revisions and any sourceciting that is required.\n\nWe look forward to working with you this fall!\n\nSincerely,\nPaul\n\nGregory Antill & Paul Meosky\n\nEditors-in-Chief\nYale Journal of Law & the Humanities\nyjlh@yale.edu\n\"\n\n\"Fwd: YJLH Remote Sourcecites, Symposium Comments, & Pizza!\",\"Hi all,\n\nI’d very much like to sign up to review some of the Symposium papers, are there still spots open?\n\nCheers,\n\nJB\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Meosky, Paul <paul.meosky@yale.edu>\nDate: 18 Oct 2021, 09:31 -0400\nTo: Antill, Gregory <gregory.antill@yale.edu>, Xu, Allen <allen.xu@yale.edu>, Barbosa Cesnik, Hannah <hannah.barbosacesnik@yale.edu>, Baughman, Jonathan <jonathan.baughman@yale.edu>, Eric Eisner <ericjeisner@gmail.com>, Stephen, Eric <eric.stephen@yale.edu>, Jocelyn Holt Correa, Emilia <emilia.jocelyn-holt@yale.edu>, Antill, Gregory <gregory.antill@yale.edu>, Xu, Allen <allen.xu@yale.edu>, Firmani, Mark <mark.firmani@yale.edu>, Dang, Tyler <tyler.dang@yale.edu>, Hopen, David <david.hopen@yale.edu>, Soinski, Saylor <saylor.soinski@yale.edu>, Rice, Stephanie <stephanie.rice@yale.edu>, van Wiltenburg, Chantelle <c.vanwiltenburg@yale.edu>, Allen, Brandy <b.allen@yale.edu>\nCc: Johnson, Alex <a.johnson@yale.edu>, Horn, Adam <adam.horn@yale.edu>, Haj Yahia, Alaa <alaa.hajyahia@yale.edu>, Chang, Bowen <bowen.chang@yale.edu>, Yoo, Daniel <d.yoo@yale.edu>, Sullivan, Grace <grace.sullivan@yale.edu>, Malley, Helen <helen.malley@yale.edu>, Ferreira Matos do Carmo, Helena <helena.ferreira@yale.edu>, May, Isaac <isaac.may@yale.edu>, Kim, Jaewon <jaewon.kim@yale.edu>, Lemaire, Jan-Baptist <jan-baptist.lemaire@yale.edu>, Feld, Jonathan <jonathan.feld@yale.edu>, Yoon, Kate <kate.yoon@yale.edu>, Dasht, Liat <liat.dasht@yale.edu>, Cherneff, Lyle <lyle.cherneff@yale.edu>, Michalek, Marcella <marcella.michalek@yale.edu>, Hay, Nathaniel <nathaniel.hay@yale.edu>, Rothstein, Talia <talia.rothstein@yale.edu>, Pinnamaneni, Sreya <sreya.pinnamaneni@yale.edu>, De Spiegeleir, Antoine <antoine.despiegeleir@yale.edu>, Antill, Gregory <gregory.antill@yale.edu>, Yale Journal of Law and Humanities <yjlh@yale.edu>\nSubject: YJLH Remote Sourcecites, Symposium Comments, & Pizza!\n\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nWe have a few quick updates and asks for you all:\n\n\nRemote Sourcecites\nWe need all hands on deck to check sources and bluebook for our Fall Issue.

Editors who complete a second sourcecite (remote or otherwise) will be promoted to Senior Editors on our Masthead. All sourceciting will be remote and on your time. We'll send instructions and blocks of footnotes to check by the end of the week. 1Ls should remember that they have a 6-hour limit for journal work in the fall, but everyone else is welcome to pitch in as much as they like.\n\n\nSymposium Comments Editors\nWe need 6 volunteers to edit comments submitted for our Fall Symposium Issue. These volunteers will be listed as Articles Editors for the special issue, but moreover, this is a unique opportunity to engage with the leading lights in American legal history. Please email the YJLH account if you are interested.

As you are aware, we are working with Prof. Priest to publish an issue on the Credit Nation Symposium, and we would love to include your comments. \n\nWe are not imposing a page limit, but we expect most comments to have no more than ten pages. We also recognize that not everyone will be familiar with our Bluebook citation style, and so we only ask that you use footnotes rather than in-text citations. We do prefer Chicago over any other non-Bluebook style, but given our journal's broad coverage, we're pretty familiar with it all.\n\nTo meet our publishing deadline, we ask that first drafts for all comments be sent to yjlh@yale.edu <mailto:yjlh@yale.edu>  no later than Friday, October 15th, at 11:59PM. Once we receive your comment, we will assign you an Articles Editor to work on revisions and any sourceciting that is required.\n\nWe look forward to working with you this fall!\n\nSincerely,\nPaul\n\nGregory Antill & Paul Meosky\n\nEditors-in-Chief\nYale Journal of Law & the Humanities\nyjlh@yale.edu\n\"\n\n\"Fwd: YJLH Remote Sourcecites, Symposium Comments, & Pizza!\",\"Hi all,\n\nI’d very much like to sign up to review some of the Symposium papers, are there still spots open?\n\nCheers, \n\nJB\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Meosky, Paul <paul.meosky@yale.edu>\nDate: 18 Oct 2021, 09:31 -0400\nTo: Antill, Gregory <gregory.antill@yale.edu>, Xu, Allen <allen.xu@yale.edu>, Barbosa Cesnik, Hannah <hannah.barbosacesnik@yale.edu>, Baughman, Jonathan <jonathan.baughman@yale.edu>, Eric Eisner <ericjeisner@gmail.com>, Stephen, Eric <eric.stephen@yale.edu>, Jocelyn Holt Correa, Emilia <emilia.jocelyn-holt@yale.edu>, Antill, Gregory <gregory.antill@yale.edu>, Xu, Allen <allen.xu@yale.edu>, Firmani, Mark <mark.firmani@yale.edu>, Dang, Tyler <tyler.dang@yale.edu>, Hopen, David <david.hopen@yale.edu>, Soinski, Saylor <saylor.soinski@yale.edu>, Rice, Stephanie <stephanie.rice@yale.edu>, van Wiltenburg, Chantelle <c.vanwiltenburg@yale.edu>, Allen, Brandy <b.allen@yale.edu>\nCc: Johnson, Alex <a.johnson@yale.edu>, Horn, Adam <adam.horn@yale.edu>, Haj Yahia, Alaa <alaa.hajyahia@yale.edu>, Chang, Bowen <bowen.chang@yale.edu>, Yoo, Daniel <d.yoo@yale.edu>, Sullivan, Grace <grace.sullivan@yale.edu>, Malley, Helen <helen.malley@yale.edu>, Ferreira Matos do Carmo, Helena <helena.ferreira@yale.edu>, May, Isaac <isaac.may@yale.edu>, Kim, Jaewon <jaewon.kim@yale.edu>, Lemaire, Jan-Baptist <jan-baptist.lemaire@yale.edu>, Feld, Jonathan <jonathan.feld@yale.edu>, Yoon, Kate <kate.yoon@yale.edu>, Dasht, Liat <liat.dasht@yale.edu>, Cherneff, Lyle <lyle.cherneff@yale.edu>, Michalek, Marcella <marcella.michalek@yale.edu>, Hay, Nathaniel <nathaniel.hay@yale.edu>, Rothstein, Talia <talia.rothstein@yale.edu>, Pinnamaneni, Sreya <sreya.pinnamaneni@yale.edu>, De Spiegeleir, Antoine <antoine.despiegeleir@yale.edu>, Antill, Gregory <gregory.antill@yale.edu>, Yale Journal of Law and Humanities <yjlh@yale.edu>\nSubject: YJLH Remote Sourcecites, Symposium Comments, & Pizza!\n\n\n\n\tHi everyone,\n\n\tWe have a few quick updates and asks for you all:\n\t\n\t\n\tRemote Sourcecites\n\tWe need all hands on deck to check sources and bluebook for our Fall Issue.

Should I just send him the date for now? Or would you like me to ask him to participate in any of the panels? I can also just ask him to RSVP directly to you, and you can discuss possibilities at that time. Please let me know what you'd prefer.\n\n \n\nBest,\n\nPaul"

I have also taken the liberty of attaching my c.v. since this is sometimes requested by journals.\n\nThank you for your kind consideration. \n\nBest, \n\nEMB\n\n\n\tEleanor Brown (202 361 5568/ 786 201 3823)\n\n\tProfessor of Law and International Affairs \n\n\tSenior Scientist, the Rock Ethics Institute \n\n\tThe Pennsylvania State University, \n\n\tImmediate Past Chair, Lutie Lytle Black Women Law Faculty Conference \n\n   \n\n\t \n\n\t https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/faculty/eleanor-brown <https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__pennstatelaw.psu.edu_faculty_eleanor-2Dbrown%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3DWO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ%26r%3DXv0QCFJtKa9Is-I1ULnDJGs1_DfxIrE1D1-9DAqx8C4%26m%3Do0oc-wYmAEwJU1oxEfJGgXkjJJ1rRmuNus2diqsyVyg%26s%3DSuKh1VFlw51nYRSqZ7tMXRnWrII2qg-IHHczHzN4ctA%26e%3D&data=04%7C01%7Cyjlh%40yale.edu%7C9e3ac7c954074b8218af08d990330504%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637699371402108135%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=1wHvilTPotJtpXroBTtqgBw3BZ%2FJiwF2%2B3IMGb7xMv4%3D&reserved=0> \n\n\t \n\n\thttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1017737 <https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__papers.ssrn.com_sol3_cf-5Fdev_AbsByAuth.cfm-3Fper-5Fid-3D1017737%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3DWO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ%26r%3DXv0QCFJtKa9Is-I1ULnDJGs1_DfxIrE1D1-9DAqx8C4%26m%3Do0oc-wYmAEwJU1oxEfJGgXkjJJ1rRmuNus2diqsyVyg%26s%3DmuQM0CxrVmA5DsH9P6rI1Kz87fY6KhJtRTUABRIqgf8%26e%3D&data=04%7C01%7Cyjlh%40yale.edu%7C9e3ac7c954074b8218af08d990330504%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637699371402118131%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=anwa2TJrCaKbpo3a3zTDdWCAUJM%2BaefIMxN9o9eEGgM%3D&reserved=0> \n\n \n\n\t\t\thttps://news.psu.edu/story/461403/2017/04/10/academics/eleanor-brown-joins-faculty-penn-state-law-sia-rock-ethics\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\tEleanor Brown joins faculty in Penn State Law, SIA, Rock Ethics Institute | Penn State University\n\nEleanor Brown, a leading scholar of property, migration, globalization, development, and the law, will join the Penn State faculty, effective July 1, as a professor of law at Penn State Law, a professor of international affairs in the School of International Affairs, an d a"

    "body": "Good morning all,\n\nMy name is Paul, and along with Greg, I am one of the Editors-in-Chief of the Yale Journal of Law & the Humanities. As you are aware, we are working with Prof. Priest to publish an issue on the Credit Nation Symposium, and we would love to include your comments.\n\nWe are not imposing a page limit, but we expect most comments to have no more than ten pages. We also recognize that not everyone will be familiar with our Bluebook citation style, and so we only ask that you use footnotes rather than in-text citations. We do prefer Chicago over any other non-Bluebook style, but given our journal's broad coverage, we're pretty familiar with it all.\n\nTo meet our publishing deadline, we ask that first drafts for all comments be sent to yjlh@yale.edu <mailto:yjlh@yale.edu>  no later than Friday, October 15th, at 11:59PM.

As you are aware, we are working with Prof. Priest to publish an issue on the Credit Nation Symposium, and we would love to include your comments. \n\nWe are not imposing a page limit, but we expect most comments to have no more than ten pages. We also recognize that not everyone will be familiar with our Bluebook citation style, and so we only ask that you use footnotes rather than in-text citations. We do prefer Chicago over any other non-Bluebook style, but given our journal's broad coverage, we're pretty familiar with it all.\n\nTo meet our publishing deadline, we ask that first drafts for all comments be sent to yjlh@yale.edu <mailto:yjlh@yale.edu>  no later than Friday, October 15th, at 11:59PM. Once we receive your comment, we will assign you an Articles Editor to work on revisions and any sourceciting that is required.\n\nWe look forward to working with you this fall!\n\nSincerely,\nPaul\n\nGregory Antill & Paul Meosky\n\nEditors-in-Chief\nYale Journal of Law & the Humanities\nyjlh@yale.edu\n\"\n\nRe: Symposium Article to Review,\"Paul,\n\nYou should know that I sent the schedule to Dan and a number of colleagues and friends yesterday, not knowing he had written that piece.\n\n \n\nBefore inviting him to take part in the conference, I’d like to touch base with Taisu and also hear back from the other panelists to see where things are.\n\nSo let’s not invite him just yet.
